.SYNOPSIS
    This script checks if the system meets the requirements for BitLocker silent encryption, including TPM version 2.0, UEFI boot mode, and Secure Boot status.

.DESCRIPTION
    The script performs a series of checks to validate that the system is equipped for BitLocker silent encryption. It checks:
    - TPM (Trusted Platform Module) availability and version (requires version 2.0 or higher).
    - UEFI firmware mode, ensuring the system is not in Legacy BIOS mode.
    - Secure Boot status, verifying if Secure Boot is enabled.

    If any of these requirements are not met, the script provides guidance for remediation.

.PARAMETER None
    This script does not accept any parameters.

.EXAMPLE
    Run the script to check if the system is BitLocker ready:
    
    ```powershell
    .\Check-BitLockerRequirements.ps1
    ```

.OUTPUTS
    Exit code 0: All requirements are met.
    Exit code 1: One or more requirements are not met.
